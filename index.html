        <h2>Project 1: Building a Data Matrix</h2>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> In this project, I created a matrix with three columns: <em>Person Name, Amount, and Employee ID</em>. This helped me Insert data efficiently. I've came across ha situation where I had to analyze hundreds of rows of data where I had to change certain hourly rate values for only a certain employee. The problem I faced was that the data wasnt organized, Meaning there was a lot of rows where the data did not correlate with other rows. Not only did I have to analyze and make sure I wasnt missing any I had to do this across 10+ worksheets.</p>
